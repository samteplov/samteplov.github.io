title: About me
---

I am a security researcher who mainly focuses on wireless technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth. I was first introduced to security research in 2017 when I joined the [Furious MAC](https://furiousmac.com) Research Group. Ever since then, I have been an active member of the group. I also enjoy reading about and working on ML/DL projects, as well DevOps, and cyber-physical systems. In my free time, I enjoy competing in various CTF challenges.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Cyber Operations from the United States Naval Academy in 2019. In 2020, I earned my Master of Information Technology Strategy from Carnegie Mellon University with a concentration in Software and Networked Systems.
