# Background
\
The initial research for this project started back in 2017 with the [Furious MAC](https://furiousmac.com/) research group. Since then, the group has disclosed multiple privacy concerns and tracking vulnerabilities in Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Continuity protocol. This protocol is responsible for creating a seamless user experience for users working across multiple Apple devices. [Features](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681) such as Handoff, Universal Clipboard, Auto Unlock, AirDrop, and more are supported by this protocol.
